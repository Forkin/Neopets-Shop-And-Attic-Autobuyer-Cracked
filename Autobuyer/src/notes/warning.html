                Neopets recently added a captcha page to the attic/main shops that they will randomly display to see if you are a human or bot while you are refreshing. This captcha is very difficult and a computer will not be able to solve it. Because of this, we have added detection of the captcha page and the autobuyer pauses if one of these pages is encountered. This will prevent endless refreshing on this captcha page. As always, it is a good practice to only run the autobuyer when you are nearby and can check on it every once in a while. Running for 8 hours a day every day will likely get you frozen, so please use the autobuyer intelligently. See the <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQ1bYmz2o92LG4sVq7CIO7tgCVl-lVreJxpIuDjd9TmFuXX166UZlqQdTWkt7VUyRkF33DvWD8ldVS8/pub">FAQ</a> link above for faster updates, as that page will be updated when anything changes.

                Attic autorefreshing has been disabled for the extension until you hit the button below acknowelding this warning that you autorefresh unattended at your own risk. You can then return to options and re-enable it if you wish.
