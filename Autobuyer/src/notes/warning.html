                Neopets has recently implemented a captcha page in the attic/main shops, which will be randomly displayed to differentiate between human users and bots during the refreshing process. This captcha is designed to be highly challenging, and cannot be solved by a computer. As a result, our team has incorporated a detection mechanism for the captcha page, causing the autobuyer to pause if one is encountered. This will effectively prevent infinite refreshing on the captcha page. We strongly advise users to operate the autobuyer within their vicinity and monitor it periodically. Repeatedly running the autobuyer for 8 hours a day may result in account freezing, therefore, we encourage users to utilize the autobuyer prudently. For timely updates, please refer the <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQ1bYmz2o92LG4sVq7CIO7tgCVl-lVreJxpIuDjd9TmFuXX166UZlqQdTWkt7VUyRkF33DvWD8ldVS8/pub">FAQ</a> link, which will be updated accordingly.

                As a safety measure, attic autorefreshing has been disabled for the extension. In order to re-enable it, users must acknowledge the warning below, acknowledging that autorefreshing unattended is done at their own risk, and then return to the options menu.
